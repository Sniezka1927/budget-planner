Homepage
The homepage would be a simple dashboard displaying the user's current expenses, income, and budget progress. It would also have a button to add a new transaction.

Transactions page
Clicking on the "Add Transaction" button would take the user to the Transactions page. Here, the user could add a new transaction by filling out a form with details such as the amount, category, and date. There would also be a table displaying all of the user's transactions, with the ability to sort and filter by date, category, and amount.

Categories page
The Categories page would allow the user to manage their expense categories. The page would display a list of categories, with the ability to add, edit, and delete categories.

Budget page
The Budget page would allow the user to set a budget for each category and track their progress. The page would display a chart showing the user's spending for each category compared to their budget.
